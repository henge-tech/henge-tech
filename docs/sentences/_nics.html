<h2>_nics</h2>
<p><em>Avionics</em>, the study of complex electronic systems used in controlling aircraft, coupled with <em>biomechanics</em>, the investigation of the mechanical laws governing movement and deformations of living tissues, and <em>cryogenics</em>, the production and behavior of materials at extremely low temperatures, have become increasingly important in modern technological advances.</p>
<p><em>Cryonics</em>, the practice of preserving a deceased person's body at very low temperatures, <em>eugenics</em>, the selective breeding of humans to improve the qualities of the species, and <em>harmonics</em>, the study of sound and its vibrations, form an important part of the modern scientific and technological landscape.</p>
<p><em>Hydroponics</em>, the science of growing plants without soil, <em>microelectronics</em>, the development and use of electronic components and systems on the nanometer scale, and <em>mnemonics</em>, the practice of using special techniques to remember information more easily, all have had a profound impact on the progress of human knowledge and technology.</p>
<p><em>Pyrotechnics</em>, the use of combustible chemicals and combustible materials to create theatrical displays, <em>tectonics</em>, the study of Earth's surface features and their changes over time, and <em>ultrasonics</em>, the branch of science that deals with sound vibrations at frequencies higher than humans can hear, have all become essential parts of modern society.</p>
