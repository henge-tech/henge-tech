<p>The <em>molar</em>s are highly important for chewing food, as they help break down the tough fibers of plants or meat into small pieces that can be digested more easily; at the same time, the <em>polar</em> nature of their structure gives them an added adhesive quality to help hold larger chunks together until they are ready to be swallowed.<br><span class="translate-links">[<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ja&text=The%20molars%20are%20highly%20important%20for%20chewing%20food%2C%20as%20they%20help%20break%20down%20the%20tough%20fibers%20of%20plants%20or%20meat%20into%20small%20pieces%20that%20can%20be%20digested%20more%20easily%3B%20at%20the%20same%20time%2C%20the%20polar%20nature%20of%20their%20structure%20gives%20them%20an%20added%20adhesive%20quality%20to%20help%20hold%20larger%20chunks%20together%20until%20they%20are%20ready%20to%20be%20swallowed." target="_blank">G</a>|<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/The%20molars%20are%20highly%20important%20for%20chewing%20food%2C%20as%20they%20help%20break%20down%20the%20tough%20fibers%20of%20plants%20or%20meat%20into%20small%20pieces%20that%20can%20be%20digested%20more%20easily%3B%20at%20the%20same%20time%2C%20the%20polar%20nature%20of%20their%20structure%20gives%20them%20an%20added%20adhesive%20quality%20to%20help%20hold%20larger%20chunks%20together%20until%20they%20are%20ready%20to%20be%20swallowed." target="_blank">D</a>]</span></p>
