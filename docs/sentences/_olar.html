<h2>_olar</h2>
<p>The neurons in the <em>alveolar</em> region of the brain are especially important for stabilizing our behavior, as they are responsible for forming the <em>bipolar</em> connections required for complex thought.</p>
<p>As telescopes improved, astronomers were able to observe celestial objects that were <em>circumpolar</em>, or visible from any point on Earth, as well as <em>extrasolar</em> planets that existed in distant solar systems far beyond our own.</p>
<p>The <em>molar</em>s are highly important for chewing food, as they help break down the tough fibers of plants or meat into small pieces that can be digested more easily; at the same time, the <em>polar</em> nature of their structure gives them an added adhesive quality to help hold larger chunks together until they are ready to be swallowed.</p>
<p>Despite its vastness, the <em>solar</em> system maintains a balance between all of its components, and the dedicated efforts of <em>scholar</em>s are needed to continue exploring and understanding this delicate balance so that our planet may stay safe and productive.</p>
