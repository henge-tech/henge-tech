<h2>_eft</h2>
<p>Bewildered and <em>bereft</em> by the deep <em>cleft</em> in his heart, he could not find solace in anything, for all that he had ever known was now being slowly <em>cleft</em> away from him.</p>
<p>With a <em>deft</em> touch, the <em>eft</em> scuttled away from the buoyant river and into the welcoming shallows of the riverbank, where it felt safe and free from the turmoil of the watery depths.</p>
<p>Lifting the heavy <em>heft</em> of the rock as if it were nothing, he smiled in satisfaction knowing that his efforts had refilled the empty cavity carved into the hillside with a new and sturdy <em>reft</em>.</p>
<p>Although dubious of his goal, he decided to go ahead with his plan, weaving and winding like a thief in the night as he stole away with the vibrant <em>weft</em> of fabric from the loom.</p>
