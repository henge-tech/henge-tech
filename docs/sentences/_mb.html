<h2>_mb</h2>
<p>With an air of <em>aplomb</em> and a spirit of adventure, the brave explorer ventured into the depths of the winding <em>catacomb</em>s, illuminated only by the weak light of a single flickering torch held in one hand and a <em>comb</em> in the other to measure the <em>coulomb</em>s of energy radiating from the walls.</p>
<p>With hasty steps, she searched desperately through the <em>crumb</em>ling <em>crumb</em>-filled crevices of the old stone hall, her voice echoing off the walls in its <em>dumb</em> fury as her gaze passed over a <em>honeycomb</em> embedded into one of the <em>jamb</em> frames.</p>
<p>As his <em>numb</em> fingers brushed lightly over the sleek fur of the <em>lamb</em>, he was transfixed by its gentle eyes and gracefully curved <em>limb</em>s, and could not help but be in awe at how the fragile creature could remain so <em>plumb</em> in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>After a long, arduous journey filled with obstacles, he finally reached his destination - the entrance to an ancient <em>tomb</em> - and as he placed his <em>thumb</em> upon the door, he resigned himself to the fact that he must <em>succumb</em> to the unknown and enter the <em>womb</em> of mystery.</p>
