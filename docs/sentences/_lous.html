<h2>_lous</h2>
<p>A <em>callous</em> and <em>credulous</em> person was so enamored with the <em>fabulous</em> and <em>anomalous</em> things they saw, that they often acted <em>frivolous</em>ly in order to remain entranced by the world around them.</p>
<p>Though the <em>miraculous</em> feats performed were nothing short of incredible, some people were still <em>jealous</em> and <em>libelous</em> of the <em>meticulous</em> work that had been put into them and thus remained <em>incredulous</em> as to how it was done.</p>
<p>In a <em>populous</em> and <em>perilous</em> city, an <em>overzealous</em> individual attempted to solve the <em>nebulous</em> problem that was hanging <em>pendulous</em>ly above their heads.</p>
<p>The <em>unscrupulous</em> and <em>zealous</em> individual, who had a <em>scurrilous</em> reputation, took advantage of the <em>scrupulous</em> and <em>tuberculous</em> people to further their own agenda.</p>
