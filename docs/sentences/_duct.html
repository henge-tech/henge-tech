<h2>_duct</h2>
<p><em>Abduct</em>ing the <em>adduct</em>or muscles, the aliens used their advanced <em>aqueduct</em>s to remove them from the planet and take them to their own world.</p>
<p>They had to abide by a strict code of <em>conduct</em> and <em>deduct</em>ively work their way through the winding <em>duct</em>s in order to find the entrance to the hidden temple.</p>
<p>The elders <em>induct</em>ed the new member into the tribe, but his <em>misconduct</em> eventually led to him being expelled, and the <em>oviduct</em>s of the female members were monitored closely to ensure his presence would not be allowed in the vicinity again.</p>
<p>The <em>product</em> of the <em>subduct</em>ion zone was an underground <em>viaduct</em> that allowed passage through the otherwise impassable terrain, allowing access to many previously unexplored locations.</p>
