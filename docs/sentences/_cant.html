<h2>_cant</h2>
<p>The <em>applicant</em> who was a <em>communicant</em> of the organization couldn't <em>decant</em> his feelings in the right way, and as a result, he was not able to communicate what he wanted to say effectively.</p>
<p>Although the <em>descant</em> and <em>desiccant</em> were <em>insignificant</em> compared to the <em>intoxicant</em>, each of their individual contributions were essential to creating the desired result.</p>
<p>Even though the <em>lubricant</em> and <em>mendicant</em> were <em>scant</em>, they still managed to <em>recant</em> their story which turned out to be highly valuable.</p>
<p>The <em>supplicant</em> made a <em>significant</em> effort to try and fill the <em>vacant</em> spot by using her <em>secant</em> approach, but unfortunately it was not enough.</p>
