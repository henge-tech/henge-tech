<p>After undergoing an <em>appendectomy</em>, the patient was delighted to discover that a <em>colostomy</em>, a procedure in which the surgeon reroutes the <em>anatomy</em> of the digestive system, had been successful.<br><span class="translate-links">[<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ja&text=After%20undergoing%20an%20appendectomy%2C%20the%20patient%20was%20delighted%20to%20discover%20that%20a%20colostomy%2C%20a%20procedure%20in%20which%20the%20surgeon%20reroutes%20the%20anatomy%20of%20the%20digestive%20system%2C%20had%20been%20successful." target="_blank">G</a>|<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/After%20undergoing%20an%20appendectomy%2C%20the%20patient%20was%20delighted%20to%20discover%20that%20a%20colostomy%2C%20a%20procedure%20in%20which%20the%20surgeon%20reroutes%20the%20anatomy%20of%20the%20digestive%20system%2C%20had%20been%20successful." target="_blank">D</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <em>dichotomy</em> between the <em>hysterectomy</em> and the <em>laparotomy</em> was clear; a <em>hysterectomy</em> removes the uterus, while a <em>laparotomy</em> is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the abdominal cavity to access the internal organs.<br><span class="translate-links">[<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ja&text=The%20dichotomy%20between%20the%20hysterectomy%20and%20the%20laparotomy%20was%20clear%3B%20a%20hysterectomy%20removes%20the%20uterus%2C%20while%20a%20laparotomy%20is%20a%20surgical%20procedure%20that%20involves%20making%20an%20incision%20in%20the%20abdominal%20cavity%20to%20access%20the%20internal%20organs." target="_blank">G</a>|<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/The%20dichotomy%20between%20the%20hysterectomy%20and%20the%20laparotomy%20was%20clear%3B%20a%20hysterectomy%20removes%20the%20uterus%2C%20while%20a%20laparotomy%20is%20a%20surgical%20procedure%20that%20involves%20making%20an%20incision%20in%20the%20abdominal%20cavity%20to%20access%20the%20internal%20organs." target="_blank">D</a>]</span></p>
