<h2>_ital</h2>
<p>We are born with a <em>congenital</em> <em>capital</em> that is essential to our <em>coital</em> success, as it serves as the foundation for much of our social and economic interactions.</p>
<p><em>Extramarital</em> affairs are often condemned as immoral and deceptive, yet the human sex drive is a powerful force that can sometimes be difficult to control, leading some people to engage in intimate <em>genital</em> relations outside of their <em>marital</em> commitment.</p>
<p>Though <em>premarital</em> relations are often frowned upon by society, many choose to pursue them as a means of exploring their passions before an <em>orbital</em> <em>recital</em> of vows and commitments.</p>
<p>The <em>vital</em> <em>urogenital</em> organs of the body are essential for survival, and as such, proper <em>requital</em> for their continued maintenance and care is a must in order to ensure their long-term efficacy and functioning.</p>
