<h2>_uth</h2>
<p>The <em>loudmouth</em> was spewing <em>bismuth</em> from his mouth in every direction, seemingly unable to control himself as he spun around in circles, his outbursts creating an ever-widening <em>azimuth</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>sleuth</em> silently watched the scene unfold with a grim determination, her <em>mouth</em> set in a hard line and icy blue eyes focused like a hawk on the source of the injustice—all of its twists and turns making her heart heavy with a sense of <em>ruth</em>.</p>
<p>The man spoke in a brash and <em>uncouth</em> manner, never pausing for breath as he marched <em>south</em>ward with an unwavering belief that his words contained the ultimate <em>truth</em>.</p>
<p>Despite the temptation of <em>vermouth</em>, the young man chose to abstain, unwilling to be deceived by <em>untruth</em>s and determined to remain a beacon of hope for his peers in the face of life’s ever-changing <em>youth</em>.</p>
