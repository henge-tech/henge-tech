<h2>_ttle</h2>
<p>During the great <em>battle</em> between the <em>belittle</em>d <em>bottle</em> and the <em>brittle</em> <em>cattle</em>, no one could have predicted that such powerful adversaries would ultimately succumb to their own fragility.</p>
<p>After the <em>kettle</em> had been boiling and the <em>little</em> <em>mettle</em> was tested, the <em>nettle</em> was proudly <em>prattle</em>d about as though it were a symbol of great strength and resilience.</p>
<p>The <em>rattle</em> of the scuttling feet, the settling of the <em>shuttle</em>, and the <em>spittle</em> expelled with such vigor were all signs that something was about to happen in the near future.</p>
<p>As the <em>tattle</em> was spreading, someone sought to <em>throttle</em> it with a <em>tittle</em>, but the <em>wattle</em> and whittling of the source kept its flame alive, proving too hot to snuff out.</p>
