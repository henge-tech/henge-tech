<p>The classic <em>archetype</em> of a person has been expressed through paintings and <em>daguerreotype</em>s for centuries, but <em>biotype</em>s are more complex ways to represent someone's unique individual features.<br><span class="translate-links">[<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ja&text=The%20classic%20archetype%20of%20a%20person%20has%20been%20expressed%20through%20paintings%20and%20daguerreotypes%20for%20centuries%2C%20but%20biotypes%20are%20more%20complex%20ways%20to%20represent%20someone%27s%20unique%20individual%20features." target="_blank">G</a>|<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/The%20classic%20archetype%20of%20a%20person%20has%20been%20expressed%20through%20paintings%20and%20daguerreotypes%20for%20centuries%2C%20but%20biotypes%20are%20more%20complex%20ways%20to%20represent%20someone%27s%20unique%20individual%20features." target="_blank">D</a>]</span></p>
