<h2>_site</h2>
<p>After camping at the <em>campsite</em> for a few days, we realized that the <em>composite</em> materials of the tent and sleeping bags we brought were not <em>apposite</em> for the cold weather.</p>
<p>The jewellery expert was mesmerized by the <em>exquisite</em> <em>marcasite</em> necklace she found at the <em>onsite</em> antique store, the intricate designs in perfect harmony.</p>
<p>Even though the <em>perquisite</em> of the manager's job was luxurious, he came to realize that the <em>parasite</em> on his schedule was having the <em>opposite</em> effect on his life and health.</p>
<p>We soon discovered that all the <em>requisite</em> items for our project were not available onsite, and so we had to purchase them from elsewhere - a <em>prerequisite</em> that we hadn't expected.</p>
