<h2>_ux</h2>
<p>The <em>beaux</em> <em>chateaux</em>, with their majestic towers and ornate spires, were often seen as the <em>crux</em> of luxury, signifying a life of wealth and privilege.</p>
<p>When a sudden <em>flux</em> of people from all around the globe attempted to cross the border, the border patrol was shocked to find so many utilizing false passports in an <em>influx</em> of undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>The <em>lux</em> that had been enjoyed by many was reduced to a trickle as the <em>reflux</em> of resources and income became more apparent, forcing people to seek alternative means of sustaining their lifestyles.</p>
<p>Couples dressed in their finest <em>tux</em> and gowns, laughed and danced around the magnificent <em>tableaux</em> of the <em>roux</em>-filled feast, as they celebrated the joy of life.</p>
