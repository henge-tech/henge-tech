<h2>_some</h2>
<p>Although it is often <em>burdensome</em> to do the right thing, it can be <em>awesome</em> to see how it can make a difference in the world, like when understanding how genes and <em>chromosome</em>s work together to provide life-saving benefits that would otherwise be <em>bothersome</em> and <em>cumbersome</em>.</p>
<p>When faced with a <em>fearsome</em> situation that seemed <em>irksome</em> and <em>loathsome</em>, it took immense courage for the <em>foursome</em> to muster the strength to push through and tackle the <em>gruesome</em> tasks ahead.</p>
<p>Although working together as a <em>threesome</em> or a foursome is not always the easiest thing to do, it can be far less <em>lonesome</em> and <em>tiresome</em> than trying to tackle a difficult task on one's own; further, it can help avoid <em>quarrelsome</em> situations when everyone cooperates towards a common goal, like helping create a <em>ribosome</em> molecule.</p>
<p>Although it may seem <em>troublesome</em> to strive for a <em>wholesome</em> lifestyle, it can be worth the effort in the long run, not only to reap the rewards of being <em>winsome</em> and worry-free, but also to avoid the <em>wearisome</em> feelings that come with leading a <em>troublesome</em> life.</p>
