<h2>_mble</h2>
<p>On an <em>amble</em> through a meadow of tall <em>bramble</em>s, they stumbled upon a loud <em>bumble</em> of hummingbees, who were happily gathering nectar, contentedly working together in an <em>ensemble</em> of buzzing and crumbling.</p>
<p>Strolling through the woods, they couldn't help but <em>fumble</em> around in the bushes, resulting in some grumbling from the group as well as a few <em>humble</em> apologies for their clumsiness; soon enough however, the trees and tall grasses had seamlessly melted into a <em>jumble</em> of mumbling shadows and shifting shapes.</p>
<p>A <em>nimble</em> fox skipped through the clearing, its russet fur resembling a river flowing over rolling stones as it paused to <em>preamble</em> around the edges, before finally picking up its pace and vanishing into the trees with a soft <em>rumble</em> of laughter echoing in its wake.</p>
<p>She stepped carefully, fearful of stumbling in the half-light, her hesitant steps accompanied by the <em>thimble</em> in her pocket, trembling with the anticipation of what she might find; suddenly she slipped, tumbling over the dewy grass and scrambling to her feet, only to <em>unscramble</em> the clues and reveal the truth of what lay beneath.</p>
