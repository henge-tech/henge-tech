<h2>_ife</h2>
<p>In the <em>afterlife</em>, the <em>fishwife</em> <em>fife</em> played a sweet melody that resonated with everyone's souls, reminding them to treasure life in their time on Earth.</p>
<p>The <em>housewife</em> carefully wielded the <em>knife</em> to cut through the wrapping paper on her wedding present while the <em>midwife</em> attended to a laboring mother in the next room.</p>
<p>The <em>nightlife</em> in the city was <em>rife</em> with excitement, so much that it seemed to be jumping off the page; a <em>penknife</em> was required to make sense of the hustle and bustle.</p>
<p>Despite the <em>strife</em> and difficulties, the <em>wife</em> was determined to protect the <em>wildlife</em> in her community, believing that every living creature had a right to thrive and enjoy life.</p>
