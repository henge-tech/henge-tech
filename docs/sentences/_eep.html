<h2>_eep</h2>
<p>The roosters around the barnyard started to <em>bleep</em> as the sun began to rise, and soon the sleepy chickens were <em>cheep</em>ing as they slowly awoke from their slumber.</p>
<p>The dampness of the morning air filled the meadow with a <em>seep</em>ing mist as the small creatures crept out of their dens, while a few birds <em>peep</em>ed from the branches of tall trees.</p>
<p>The fog was rolled up like a blanket over the <em>steep</em> hills as the shepherd herded his flock of <em>sheep</em>, their woolly coats swishing together with each <em>sweep</em> of his crook.</p>
<p>As the <em>veep</em> of the company gave his speech, many in the audience kept up their murmured conversations while a few people wept at the powerful words he spoke about the importance of <em>upkeep</em> and maintenance.</p>
