<h2>_amer</h2>
<p>As a <em>daydreamer</em>, I often find myself adding extra <em>creamer</em> to my coffee in the hopes of inducing a dreamy state.</p>
<p>The <em>gamer</em> tried to keep a low profile, but his <em>lamer</em> moves gave him away and he was mocked by the other players, who referred to him as a <em>gossamer</em>-like presence on the field.</p>
<p>The <em>roamer</em> wandered through the woods, coming across a clearing where a <em>screamer</em> was frantically reaming a tree with a tool.</p>
<p>The <em>streamer</em> sat in front of her webcam, soothing the wildest of beasts with her gentle voice as she worked to tame them on her live animal training show, which was broadcast via a popular steaming platform.</p>
