<h2>_tie</h2>
<p><em>Auntie</em> <em>Christie</em> had a pair of <em>bootie</em>s, which was her favorite because they were soft and comfy, and she loved wearing them everywhere she went.</p>
<p><em>Hottie</em> <em>Cutie</em> had a pair of <em>footie</em>s that made her feet look even cuter than usual and she would get compliments from everyone whenever she wore them out.</p>
<p><em>Sortie</em> <em>Softie</em> cherished her <em>nightie</em>, which was made from the softest fabric, and she wore it every evening to ensure a good night's sleep.</p>
<p><em>Sweetie</em> <em>Untie</em> was an expert at tying up her shoes, so she always made sure to <em>untie</em> them before she went to sleep to avoid any discomfort while she was resting.</p>
