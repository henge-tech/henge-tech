<h2>_tum</h2>
<p>An <em>arboretum</em> is a place where trees and plants are grown in a specialized environment and carefully maintained; as such, it can be seen as a <em>datum</em> of information about the diversity of nature, while a <em>dictum</em> is an authoritative statement based on facts and knowledge, making a <em>factotum</em> the perfect combination of both - someone who can make use of this valuable data and create something extraordinary.</p>
<p><em>Momentum</em> is a measure of an object's inertia or its ability to maintain its speed and direction; <em>postpartum</em> can similarly refer to the recovery process of a person or event, whether referring to physical well-being or the aftermath of a momentous occasion; <em>quantum</em> is a concept of measurement, applicable to both the subatomic world and everyday life, while the <em>rectum</em> is often overlooked in terms of importance, but nevertheless serves a vital role in digestion and waste management.</p>
<p><em>Sanctum</em> is a sanctified space or area, typically used for religious ceremonies or spiritual meditations; <em>scrotum</em> is the pouch of skin containing the testicles, a vital part of male reproductive health; <em>septum</em> refers to the wall-like divisions which form in various organs and structures; and <em>sputum</em> is a type of mucus produced as a result of an infection or inflammation of the respiratory system.</p>
<p><em>Stratum</em> is an organized layer of a material, which can be physical or conceptual; <em>substratum</em> is the underlying foundation of something, providing the basis for further growth or development; <em>tum</em> is an onomatopoeic term which implies a movement, often when referring to a swelling or rising of emotion; and an <em>ultimatum</em> is a final demand or proposition issued with a clear deadline, holding serious consequences if ignored.</p>
