<h2>_oe</h2>
<p>The <em>aloe</em> quickly grew back, but the <em>backhoe</em> was too large to fit in the <em>canoe</em>, so the <em>doe</em> had to swim across the lake by herself.</p>
<p>The <em>floe</em> floated in the river, and the <em>foe</em> watched from the shore with his <em>hoe</em> in hand, while the <em>horseshoe</em> clinked against the stones as it was swept downstream.</p>
<p>The <em>mistletoe</em> hung gracefully from the tree, and the <em>oboe</em>'s melody echoed through the air followed by the distinct thumping sound of <em>roe</em> hitting the <em>shoe</em> of the dancer as they moved across the floor.</p>
<p>The <em>throe</em> of pain reverberated throughout the room, and the <em>tiptoe</em> of her feet could barely be heard above the sound of her heartache as she dragged her <em>toe</em> behind her and lamented her <em>woe</em>.</p>
