<h2>_arge</h2>
<p>The <em>barge</em> slowly made its way down the river as the captain barked out orders to the crew to <em>charge</em> the engines and prepare for a <em>countercharge</em> against the rival shipping company that had been encroaching on their territory.</p>
<p>After the heavy rain, the river's <em>discharge</em> had significantly increased causing the water to <em>enlarge</em> and overflow its banks, creating a <em>large</em> and dangerous current.</p>
<p>The store clerk was caught <em>marge</em> overcharging customers for the store's products and was fired, but after some time, he decided to <em>recharge</em> his career by opening his own store with fair prices and honest business practices.</p>
<p>The <em>sarge</em> was in charge of training the new recruits, but he realized that they needed something extra to give them an edge in battle, so he decided to <em>supercharge</em> their training regimen by adding a rigorous physical fitness program, but the extra cost incurred a <em>surcharge</em> on the department's budget.</p>
