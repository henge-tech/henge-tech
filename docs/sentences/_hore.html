<h2>_hore</h2>
<p>After the long day at sea, the sailors were relieved to finally see land and set <em>ashore</em> to tend to their various <em>chore</em>s and explore the <em>foreshore</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>inshore</em> waters were calm and clear, but as the boat moved further out towards the <em>nearshore</em>, the waves grew larger and more turbulent due to the <em>longshore</em> current.</p>
<p>The <em>offshore</em> oil rig was visible from the sandy <em>seashore</em>, but it was a long journey by boat to reach it. <em>Onshore</em>, the small town bustled with tourists and locals alike, enjoying the warm summer weather.</p>
<p>The <em>semaphore</em> tower on the <em>shore</em> signaled to the approaching ship that it was safe to come in and dock, while the group of women standing nearby, who were known to be prostitutes, watched with a mix of boredom and desperation.</p>
