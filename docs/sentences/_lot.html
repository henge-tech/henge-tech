<h2>_lot</h2>
<p>The <em>allot</em>ment of the <em>ballot</em> was <em>blot</em>ted out due to numerous mistakes, so all the votes had to be tallied anew, making sure that no <em>blot</em> remained on the electoral process.</p>
<p>The <em>harlot</em>'s <em>lot</em> was unfortunate, as her immoral ways had earned her a reputation of ill repute, resulting in a heavy and unavoidable <em>clot</em> of judgement from the outraged public.</p>
<p>The <em>ocelot</em>, with its remarkable ability to speak in many languages, was <em>plot</em>ting an escape from its captivity, for it had a special affinity for the <em>polyglot</em> of freedom.</p>
<p>The <em>shallot</em>-filled <em>slot</em> was eagerly filled by the <em>zealot</em>, who believed that their actions would help bring about the much-desired change they had so fervently sought.</p>
