<h2>_eave</h2>
<p>He was <em>bereave</em>d of his parents when they tragically perished in a fire, but he <em>cleave</em>d onto the <em>eave</em> of their home as if it were a reminder of a precious past life.</p>
<p>After days of hard labor, heaving rocks from the land to create a deep trench, he was <em>greave</em>d from head to toe with dirt and sweat, yet he <em>interleave</em>d some measure of joy into the grueling task.</p>
<p>The tapestry of life is interwoven with a multitude of souls, both coming and going, where some may <em>leave</em> in sorrow and others may <em>reave</em> in joy; such are the mysteries that one must weave together.</p>
<p>As if part of a great machine, he labored with all his might, weaving and sheaving, sleaving and reaving, in the hope of creating something beautiful and lasting.</p>
