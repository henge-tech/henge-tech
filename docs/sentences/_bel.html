<h2>_bel</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, in a distant land, there lived a tribe of people who spoke a strange and beautiful language called <em>Babel</em>, and the Fish of Wisdom known as <em>Barbel</em> roamed the rivers, imparting knowledge to all who would listen.</p>
<p>Sitting peacefully on a ledge, the <em>Corbel</em> observed the chirping birds and crickets with a discerning ear, measuring their sounds with an accurate <em>decibel</em> meter before entering the data into his journal.</p>
<p><em>Jezebel</em> had long been known for her rebellion and boldly living outside the box, but it was only when she discarded the <em>label</em>s that others had placed on her that she realized how truly free she could be.</p>
<p>The <em>libel</em>ous accusations against the <em>rebel</em> caused a stir in the town, leading many to question the validity of the claims and sparking heated debates about whether or not justice would be served.</p>
