<h2>_don</h2>
<p>The people in the small village near the border had to <em>abandon</em> their homes and <em>cordon</em> off their land in order to protect themselves from an impending enemy attack.</p>
<p>There was an abundance of <em>cotyledon</em>s in the garden, and the friendly old man named <em>Don</em> was always keen to point them out to anyone who passed by.</p>
<p>The ancient tribe of <em>Myrmidon</em>s once used the bones of the <em>mastodon</em> as tools, and they were renowned for their strength and wisdom.</p>
<p>The air inside the cave was filled with a deadly amount of <em>radon</em>, and the adventurers had to be careful to avoid any contact with the fragile <em>tendon</em>s located in its walls.</p>
