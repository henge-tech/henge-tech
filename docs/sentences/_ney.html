<h2>_ney</h2>
<p>When the <em>attorney</em> was trying to come up with a valid argument in court, he found that his opponent's argument was nothing more than <em>baloney</em>, so he called him out and exclaimed "You can take your <em>barney</em>s and go home!"</p>
<p>When the old <em>carney</em> made his way up the <em>chimney</em>, he was full of <em>blarney</em>, telling stories and singing songs as he climbed higher and higher in pursuit of a better view from the top.</p>
<p>The <em>cockney</em> chef was determined to make the most delicious <em>chutney</em> for her customers, so she worked diligently and carefully to prepare it, then wheeled it to the table on a <em>gurney</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>hackney</em> driver was eager to show off his city to the out-of-towners, so he took them on a <em>tourney</em> around the town, taking them by the <em>kidney</em> and pointing out all the interesting sights along the way.</p>
