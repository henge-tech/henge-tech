<h2>_lve</h2>
<p>After hours of delving into the mystery, I was finally able to <em>absolve</em> the <em>bivalve</em> of any guilt and <em>calve</em> a solution that seemed to please everyone.</p>
<p>After much deliberation, it was decided that the best course of action was to <em>devolve</em> the decision-making process and <em>halve</em> any associated costs, while simultaneously allowing the situation to <em>dissolve</em> and <em>evolve</em> into something more suitable.</p>
<p>The team worked diligently to <em>involve</em> all of the necessary resources to <em>helve</em> the issue and eventually managed to <em>resolve</em> it by revolving through multiple options before finally finding a successful solution.</p>
<p>After much trial and error, we managed to <em>salve</em> the issue by finding a <em>valve</em> to shut off the water, while also shelving the problem until we could find a more permanent solution that would ultimately <em>solve</em> the dilemma.</p>
