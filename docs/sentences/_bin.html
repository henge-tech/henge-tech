<h2>_bin</h2>
<p><em>Bobbin</em>, or a small spool of thread, can often be found in a <em>bin</em> as it is used to store and organize the thread before use.</p>
<p><em>Dobbin</em> was always a reliable horse, which is why the farmer chose to keep him in the <em>cabin</em> near the family home - it was a sign of respect that he was given such a special place to stay.</p>
<p><em>Jacobin</em> was a revolutionary and dedicated supporter of the fight for freedom, and his red <em>hemoglobin</em> spoke loudly of his commitment to a noble cause.</p>
<p>In the garden, a <em>robin</em> was perched atop a <em>nubbin</em> on the tree, contemplating the world below as he basked in the sunshine.</p>
