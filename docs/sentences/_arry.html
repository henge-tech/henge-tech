<h2>_arry</h2>
<p>As the two neighboring tribes began to <em>intermarry</em>, they discovered that their long-standing feuds and attempts to <em>harry</em> each other were unnecessary and decided to live in peace.</p>
<p>As I tried to <em>parry</em> the blow of my opponent's sword during our fencing match, I felt a sudden cramp in my stomach and realized that I was <em>miscarry</em>ing the baby I had been so excited to have.</p>
<p>After years of working in the <em>quarry</em>, my father decided to retire and <em>remarry</em>, and he moved to a small town where he could spend his days fishing and enjoying the company of his new wife.</p>
<p>As we sat under the <em>starry</em> sky and <em>tarry</em>, we watched the shooting stars and made wishes on them, it was a moment I will always cherish and remember.</p>
