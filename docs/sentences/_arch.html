<h2>_arch</h2>
<p>As the group of protesters <em>frogmarch</em>ed their way through the streets, they passed by an old cathedral with a grand <em>arch</em>, and one of the demonstrators jokingly suggested that they should use <em>cornstarch</em> instead of flour to make their protest signs more durable.</p>
<p>As the <em>larch</em> trees shed their needles in the autumn, the <em>matriarch</em> of the family reflected on the passing of time and the rise and fall of <em>monarch</em>s throughout history, wondering if the current ruling <em>monarch</em> would be remembered as just a fleeting figure or a true leader in the annals of time.</p>
<p>The <em>oligarch</em> sat in his opulent office, watching as the city below him <em>parch</em> under the scorching sun, feeling a sense of satisfaction as he reflected on how he and his fellow <em>patriarch</em>s of industry controlled the fate of the nation and its people with their immense wealth and power.</p>
<p>As the scientist embarked on a new <em>research</em> project, he <em>search</em>ed tirelessly through stacks of papers and journals, looking for any clues or leads that would help him understand the properties of <em>starch</em> and how it could be used in new and innovative ways.</p>
