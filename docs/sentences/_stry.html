<h2>_stry</h2>
<p>Mr. Jones was a master of both <em>ancestry</em> and <em>artistry</em>, as evidenced by his impressive <em>dentistry</em> skills, which had been passed down to him through generations of his family.</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith had a strong belief in the <em>forestry</em> <em>ministry</em>, and she was renowned for her knowledge of <em>palmistry</em>, which she often used to trace back ancestral roots and gain insight into other people's lives.</p>
<p>The baker's <em>pastry</em> creations were so exquisite that they had to be captured with <em>photochemistry</em> in order to be immortalized in the <em>registry</em> of the world's most delicious desserts.</p>
<p>After her years of learning <em>sophistry</em>, Mary was able to create a stunning <em>tapestry</em> that hung in the <em>vestry</em> of the local church, making her the envy of all who saw it.</p>
