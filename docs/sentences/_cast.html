<h2>_cast</h2>
<p>Although the <em>broadcast</em>er predicted the weather to be <em>downcast</em>, the <em>forecast</em> was ultimately optimistic and the <em>broadcast</em> ended on an upbeat note.</p>
<p>The actor was <em>miscast</em> in his role so he was made an <em>outcast</em> and the film's <em>opencast</em> set was destroyed in the process.</p>
<p>The <em>precast</em> parts of the set were too gloomy due to the <em>overcast</em> sky and had to be <em>recast</em> with brighter colors in order to make the scene look more vibrant.</p>
<p>The actor was <em>typecast</em> to a certain role and, as a result, all his future roles were somewhat similar and, for his latest project, he was <em>simulcast</em> on all major TV channels for the <em>telecast</em>.</p>
