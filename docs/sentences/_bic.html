<h2>_bic</h2>
<p>When engaging in an <em>aerobic</em> activity, our bodies produce energy through <em>aerobic</em> respiration and the result is a pleasant, <em>acerbic</em> feeling of invigoration; however, if the same activity is done without adequate oxygen, it is then referred to as <em>anaerobic</em>, which can result in fatigue.</p>
<p>The <em>claustrophobic</em> feeling of being confined in a small, <em>cubic</em> space can be very overwhelming, so much so that it can cause a psychological reaction that is similar to the fear and hatred of homosexuals, otherwise known as homophobia.</p>
<p><em>Hydrophobic</em>ity is a condition in which water is repelled from a surface, and can often be observed when comparing <em>iambic</em> verses to <em>monosyllabic</em> words, as the former tend to have greater syllable counts and are more difficult to pronounce.</p>
<p>While <em>pubic</em> hair often serves a cosmetic purpose, it also serves an important linguistic one, as <em>syllabic</em> and <em>xenophobic</em> words, which are more difficult to pronounce, can often be made easier to enunciate by adding a few extra syllables.</p>
