<p>When engaging in an <em>aerobic</em> activity, our bodies produce energy through <em>aerobic</em> respiration and the result is a pleasant, <em>acerbic</em> feeling of invigoration; however, if the same activity is done without adequate oxygen, it is then referred to as <em>anaerobic</em>, which can result in fatigue.<br><span class="translate-links">[<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ja&text=When%20engaging%20in%20an%20aerobic%20activity%2C%20our%20bodies%20produce%20energy%20through%20aerobic%20respiration%20and%20the%20result%20is%20a%20pleasant%2C%20acerbic%20feeling%20of%20invigoration%3B%20however%2C%20if%20the%20same%20activity%20is%20done%20without%20adequate%20oxygen%2C%20it%20is%20then%20referred%20to%20as%20anaerobic%2C%20which%20can%20result%20in%20fatigue." target="_blank">G</a>|<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/When%20engaging%20in%20an%20aerobic%20activity%2C%20our%20bodies%20produce%20energy%20through%20aerobic%20respiration%20and%20the%20result%20is%20a%20pleasant%2C%20acerbic%20feeling%20of%20invigoration%3B%20however%2C%20if%20the%20same%20activity%20is%20done%20without%20adequate%20oxygen%2C%20it%20is%20then%20referred%20to%20as%20anaerobic%2C%20which%20can%20result%20in%20fatigue." target="_blank">D</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <em>claustrophobic</em> feeling of being confined in a small, <em>cubic</em> space can be very overwhelming, so much so that it can cause a psychological reaction that is similar to the fear and hatred of homosexuals, otherwise known as homophobia.<br><span class="translate-links">[<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ja&text=The%20claustrophobic%20feeling%20of%20being%20confined%20in%20a%20small%2C%20cubic%20space%20can%20be%20very%20overwhelming%2C%20so%20much%20so%20that%20it%20can%20cause%20a%20psychological%20reaction%20that%20is%20similar%20to%20the%20fear%20and%20hatred%20of%20homosexuals%2C%20otherwise%20known%20as%20homophobia." target="_blank">G</a>|<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/The%20claustrophobic%20feeling%20of%20being%20confined%20in%20a%20small%2C%20cubic%20space%20can%20be%20very%20overwhelming%2C%20so%20much%20so%20that%20it%20can%20cause%20a%20psychological%20reaction%20that%20is%20similar%20to%20the%20fear%20and%20hatred%20of%20homosexuals%2C%20otherwise%20known%20as%20homophobia." target="_blank">D</a>]</span></p>
<p><em>Hydrophobic</em>ity is a condition in which water is repelled from a surface, and can often be observed when comparing <em>iambic</em> verses to <em>monosyllabic</em> words, as the former tend to have greater syllable counts and are more difficult to pronounce.<br><span class="translate-links">[<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ja&text=Hydrophobicity%20is%20a%20condition%20in%20which%20water%20is%20repelled%20from%20a%20surface%2C%20and%20can%20often%20be%20observed%20when%20comparing%20iambic%20verses%20to%20monosyllabic%20words%2C%20as%20the%20former%20tend%20to%20have%20greater%20syllable%20counts%20and%20are%20more%20difficult%20to%20pronounce." target="_blank">G</a>|<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/Hydrophobicity%20is%20a%20condition%20in%20which%20water%20is%20repelled%20from%20a%20surface%2C%20and%20can%20often%20be%20observed%20when%20comparing%20iambic%20verses%20to%20monosyllabic%20words%2C%20as%20the%20former%20tend%20to%20have%20greater%20syllable%20counts%20and%20are%20more%20difficult%20to%20pronounce." target="_blank">D</a>]</span></p>
<p>While <em>pubic</em> hair often serves a cosmetic purpose, it also serves an important linguistic one, as <em>syllabic</em> and <em>xenophobic</em> words, which are more difficult to pronounce, can often be made easier to enunciate by adding a few extra syllables.<br><span class="translate-links">[<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ja&text=While%20pubic%20hair%20often%20serves%20a%20cosmetic%20purpose%2C%20it%20also%20serves%20an%20important%20linguistic%20one%2C%20as%20syllabic%20and%20xenophobic%20words%2C%20which%20are%20more%20difficult%20to%20pronounce%2C%20can%20often%20be%20made%20easier%20to%20enunciate%20by%20adding%20a%20few%20extra%20syllables." target="_blank">G</a>|<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/While%20pubic%20hair%20often%20serves%20a%20cosmetic%20purpose%2C%20it%20also%20serves%20an%20important%20linguistic%20one%2C%20as%20syllabic%20and%20xenophobic%20words%2C%20which%20are%20more%20difficult%20to%20pronounce%2C%20can%20often%20be%20made%20easier%20to%20enunciate%20by%20adding%20a%20few%20extra%20syllables." target="_blank">D</a>]</span></p>
