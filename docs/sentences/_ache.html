<h2>_ache</h2>
<p>The soldier's leg ached from the long march, but he knew he had to keep going as he was part of the Apache detachment. He grabbed his backpack and checked to make sure his attache case was secure before continuing on the mission.</p>
<p>I woke up with a terrible backache and a bellyache this morning, and I can't find my cache of headache medicine anywhere.</p>
<p>My earache was so painful that I couldn't concentrate on painting with my gouache set, and the thought of my recent heartache only made it worse.</p>
<p>I bought a pair of colorful huarache sandals to wear to the beach, and paired them with my favorite mustache T-shirt for a touch of panache.</p>
