<h2>_mper</h2>
<p>A <em>bumper</em> in the road dampened our spirits, and even though we tried to remain in good <em>distemper</em>, our enthusiasm was frayed by the presence of a huge <em>dumper</em> truck.</p>
<p>We were all delighted to find a <em>hamper</em> in the corner of the room and immediately began searching for something that we could use as a <em>jumper</em>; however, our excitement was quelled when we realized that the <em>plumper</em> had been <em>pamper</em>ed too much and was too old for us to use.</p>
<p>As we attempted to run away, our <em>romper</em> prevented us from making any swift escape and we could only <em>scamper</em> a few steps before a mysterious figure halted us in our tracks and gave us a <em>simper</em>ing smile, stumping us with their enchanting charm.</p>
<p>Despite our efforts to <em>tamper</em> with the box in the corner, we soon realized that our <em>temper</em> was getting the best of us and we tramped off in a huff, <em>whimper</em>ing at our failed attempt.</p>
