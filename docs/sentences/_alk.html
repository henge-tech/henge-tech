<h2>_alk</h2>
<p>I tried to climb up the <em>beanstalk</em>, but every time I tried, I would get scared and <em>balk</em>, and my sister would just roll her eyes and <em>backtalk</em> me.</p>
<p>I strolled down the <em>boardwalk</em>, enjoying the warm sun on my face and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. It was such a <em>cakewalk</em>, I barely broke a sweat. Later that evening, I headed to the fashion show and watched the models strut their stuff on the <em>catwalk</em>.</p>
<p>As I walked across the <em>crosswalk</em> on my way to school, I couldn't help but notice the beautiful <em>chalk</em> art on the sidewalk. It was such a bright and cheerful scene, it made me feel happy just looking at it. Suddenly, I heard a loud voice behind me, and when I turned around, I saw two people deep in <em>crosstalk</em>, completely unaware of their surroundings.</p>
<p>As I walked home from the grocery store, I couldn't help but notice the full moon in the sky. It was so bright and beautiful, it seemed to be following me as I made my way down the <em>sidewalk</em>. I tried to <em>moonwalk</em> for a bit, just for fun, but I ended up tripping and almost falling on the <em>stalk</em> of a weed that had grown up through a crack in the pavement.</p>
