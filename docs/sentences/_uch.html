<h2>_uch</h2>
<p>The lounger on the patio was so comfortable that he decided to <em>crouch</em> down on it and <em>debauch</em> the afternoon away, forgetting all of his worries as he sank into the soft cushions of the <em>couch</em>.</p>
<p>Full of ambition and determination, the <em>eunuch</em> <em>debouch</em>ed his way out of the palace, a scowl plastered on his face as he marched away with a distinct air of <em>grouch</em>iness.</p>
<p><em>Inasmuch</em> as he had always been a light traveler, he made sure to make the most of his limited space and carefully placed everything he needed within his small <em>pouch</em>, <em>insomuch</em> that it was almost bursting at the seams.</p>
<p>With a few deft strokes, the painter <em>retouch</em>ed the canvas, <em>slouch</em>ing in his chair as he took a step back to take in the beauty of his work, <em>vouch</em>ing that this painting would surpass even his own expectations.</p>
