<p>I found a cozy <em>cardigan</em> and a pair of durable <em>brogan</em>s in the closet, but my favorite pair of shoes is still my trusty <em>hogan</em> sneakers.</p>
<p>The <em>hooligan</em> disrupted the <em>pagan</em> ceremony by sneaking into the church and playing a loud tune on the <em>organ</em>.</p>
