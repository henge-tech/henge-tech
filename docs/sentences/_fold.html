<h2>_fold</h2>
<p>I pulled out my <em>billfold</em> to pay for the <em>blindfold</em> that I had just bought to use while performing the new yoga <em>centerfold</em> routine.</p>
<p>As I <em>fold</em>ed the blankets, I couldn't help but notice how the soft fabric seemed to <em>enfold</em> me in warmth and comfort. Later, as I browsed through a magazine, I was intrigued by the intricate <em>gatefold</em> that revealed a hidden image.</p>
<p>The <em>manifold</em> of pipes on the <em>scaffold</em> above the construction site was a confusing network of metal, but the <em>sheepfold</em> below was a simple, peaceful place where the animals could rest.</p>
<p>As I <em>unfold</em>ed the map, I was amazed to see that it had been folded and refolded so many times that it had increased in size a <em>thousandfold</em>. Despite this, the intricate details of the landscape were still visible, and I knew that studying it would help me navigate my journey <em>twofold</em>.</p>
