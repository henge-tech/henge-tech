<h2>_rism</h2>
<p>An <em>aphorism</em> that has been used to explain the human condition throughout history is that ‘<em>barbarism</em> is the result of poor <em>behaviorism</em>’; in other words, any kind of behavior which deviates from the accepted norms of society is likely to lead to a state of <em>barbarism</em>.</p>
<p><em>Consumerism</em>, <em>futurism</em> and <em>militarism</em> are three interlinked ideologies that have had a major impact on the modern world; from creating a culture of rampant materialism to shaping political policies which prioritize military power over diplomacy, these philosophies have come to define the 21st Century.</p>
<p><em>Naturism</em>, <em>plagiarism</em> and <em>secularism</em> are all concepts that have grown in prominence over the last few decades; while <em>naturism</em> promotes a more sustainable lifestyle, <em>plagiarism</em> is the practice of stealing someone else's ideas without giving them due credit, and <em>secularism</em> is the belief in separation of church and state.</p>
<p><em>Tourism</em>, <em>volunteerism</em> and <em>voyeurism</em> are all popular pastimes which have exploded in recent years; from exploring different cities and cultures through <em>tourism</em>, to helping out underprivileged communities through <em>volunteerism</em>, to observing others without their consent through <em>voyeurism</em>, these activities can be either positive or negative depending on how they are used.</p>
