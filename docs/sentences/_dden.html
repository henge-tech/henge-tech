<h2>_dden</h2>
<p>After years of being <em>bedridden</em> and <em>downtrodden</em>, he felt as if all his hopes were <em>forbidden</em> and <em>bidden</em> away from his life.</p>
<p>Even though he was <em>hidden</em> in the <em>midden</em>, his heart was <em>gladden</em> when he found out his dreams were not completely <em>madden</em> by life's difficulties.</p>
<p>Even though he had been <em>ridden</em> with sorrow and fears, and his heart was heavily <em>sadden</em>, his will to succeed was never <em>overridden</em> by a sense of despair that turned his cheeks to <em>redden</em>.</p>
<p>As his footsteps were <em>sudden</em>ly <em>trodden</em> onto the <em>sodden</em> ground, a wave of <em>unbidden</em> emotion overwhelmed him and for a moment the world seemed to stand still.</p>
