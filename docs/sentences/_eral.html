<p>The <em>federal</em> government was looking for a way to make their relationship more <em>bilateral</em>, so they created a <em>collateral</em> agreement that would be <em>ephemeral</em> but with equal rights and responsibilities on both sides of the <em>equilateral</em> partnership.<br><span class="translate-links">[<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ja&text=The%20federal%20government%20was%20looking%20for%20a%20way%20to%20make%20their%20relationship%20more%20bilateral%2C%20so%20they%20created%20a%20collateral%20agreement%20that%20would%20be%20ephemeral%20but%20with%20equal%20rights%20and%20responsibilities%20on%20both%20sides%20of%20the%20equilateral%20partnership." target="_blank">G</a>|<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/The%20federal%20government%20was%20looking%20for%20a%20way%20to%20make%20their%20relationship%20more%20bilateral%2C%20so%20they%20created%20a%20collateral%20agreement%20that%20would%20be%20ephemeral%20but%20with%20equal%20rights%20and%20responsibilities%20on%20both%20sides%20of%20the%20equilateral%20partnership." target="_blank">D</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <em>general</em> public was aghast when they heard that the <em>feral</em> behavior of the <em>illiberal</em> politicians had resulted in a <em>funeral</em> procession for a young man who was unjustly killed by their own <em>humeral</em> arrogance.<br><span class="translate-links">[<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ja&text=The%20general%20public%20was%20aghast%20when%20they%20heard%20that%20the%20feral%20behavior%20of%20the%20illiberal%20politicians%20had%20resulted%20in%20a%20funeral%20procession%20for%20a%20young%20man%20who%20was%20unjustly%20killed%20by%20their%20own%20humeral%20arrogance." target="_blank">G</a>|<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/The%20general%20public%20was%20aghast%20when%20they%20heard%20that%20the%20feral%20behavior%20of%20the%20illiberal%20politicians%20had%20resulted%20in%20a%20funeral%20procession%20for%20a%20young%20man%20who%20was%20unjustly%20killed%20by%20their%20own%20humeral%20arrogance." target="_blank">D</a>]</span></p>
<p>Although the <em>numeral</em> evidence suggested that <em>peripheral</em> nations could benefit from a <em>multilateral</em> approach, it was difficult to achieve the <em>lateral</em> harmony needed to craft an agreement that would be <em>puerperal</em> and beneficial in the long run.<br><span class="translate-links">[<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ja&text=Although%20the%20numeral%20evidence%20suggested%20that%20peripheral%20nations%20could%20benefit%20from%20a%20multilateral%20approach%2C%20it%20was%20difficult%20to%20achieve%20the%20lateral%20harmony%20needed%20to%20craft%20an%20agreement%20that%20would%20be%20puerperal%20and%20beneficial%20in%20the%20long%20run." target="_blank">G</a>|<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/Although%20the%20numeral%20evidence%20suggested%20that%20peripheral%20nations%20could%20benefit%20from%20a%20multilateral%20approach%2C%20it%20was%20difficult%20to%20achieve%20the%20lateral%20harmony%20needed%20to%20craft%20an%20agreement%20that%20would%20be%20puerperal%20and%20beneficial%20in%20the%20long%20run." target="_blank">D</a>]</span></p>
<p>Even though the evidence was <em>several</em> and <em>visceral</em>, the leaders were unable to come to a <em>unilateral</em> agreement and instead chose to form a <em>quadrilateral</em> coalition with a <em>unicameral</em> system to ensure that all parties could benefit.<br><span class="translate-links">[<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=ja&text=Even%20though%20the%20evidence%20was%20several%20and%20visceral%2C%20the%20leaders%20were%20unable%20to%20come%20to%20a%20unilateral%20agreement%20and%20instead%20chose%20to%20form%20a%20quadrilateral%20coalition%20with%20a%20unicameral%20system%20to%20ensure%20that%20all%20parties%20could%20benefit." target="_blank">G</a>|<a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#en/ja/Even%20though%20the%20evidence%20was%20several%20and%20visceral%2C%20the%20leaders%20were%20unable%20to%20come%20to%20a%20unilateral%20agreement%20and%20instead%20chose%20to%20form%20a%20quadrilateral%20coalition%20with%20a%20unicameral%20system%20to%20ensure%20that%20all%20parties%20could%20benefit." target="_blank">D</a>]</span></p>
