<h2>_eral</h2>
<p>The <em>federal</em> government was looking for a way to make their relationship more <em>bilateral</em>, so they created a <em>collateral</em> agreement that would be <em>ephemeral</em> but with equal rights and responsibilities on both sides of the <em>equilateral</em> partnership.</p>
<p>The <em>general</em> public was aghast when they heard that the <em>feral</em> behavior of the <em>illiberal</em> politicians had resulted in a <em>funeral</em> procession for a young man who was unjustly killed by their own <em>humeral</em> arrogance.</p>
<p>Although the <em>numeral</em> evidence suggested that <em>peripheral</em> nations could benefit from a <em>multilateral</em> approach, it was difficult to achieve the <em>lateral</em> harmony needed to craft an agreement that would be <em>puerperal</em> and beneficial in the long run.</p>
<p>Even though the evidence was <em>several</em> and <em>visceral</em>, the leaders were unable to come to a <em>unilateral</em> agreement and instead chose to form a <em>quadrilateral</em> coalition with a <em>unicameral</em> system to ensure that all parties could benefit.</p>
