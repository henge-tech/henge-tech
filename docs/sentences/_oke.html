<h2>_oke</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a <em>bloke</em> who was so poor that he had to resort to swimming <em>breaststroke</em> to make ends meet, but luckily he was able to purchase a <em>bespoke</em> suit from a kind tailor at a price he could afford, even though he was <em>broke</em>.</p>
<p>When I was young, I heard a story about a brave knight who could <em>evoke</em> powerful spells by chanting an incantation and tapping his sword on the ground, only to <em>choke</em> up and lose his ability to <em>invoke</em> the magic when the enemy charged.</p>
<p>The wicked king's adviser tried to <em>stoke</em> his anger by poking and provoking him, but his daughter would often <em>revoke</em> the adviser's orders and calm the king down.</p>
<p>The farmer worked his fields with the help of a <em>yoke</em> connected to two oxen, and would take regular breaks in the shade to sip water and <em>toke</em> on the pipe he kept in his pocket as protection against <em>sunstroke</em>.</p>
