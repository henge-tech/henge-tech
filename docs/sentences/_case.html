<h2>_case</h2>
<p>The <em>bookcase</em> was filled with books, the <em>briefcase</em> was carefully tucked beneath it, and the <em>crankcase</em> was used to power a nearby machine that kept the room illuminated.</p>
<p>She <em>encase</em>d her head in a protective <em>headcase</em> and, against all odds, managed to find the <em>lowercase</em> letters tucked away in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>The <em>nutcase</em> was madly pacing around the room, proclaiming his theories to anyone who would listen, while the <em>pillowcase</em> lay crumpled at his feet, and the <em>showcase</em> nearby seemed to contain a series of odd items that further supported his case.</p>
<p>She carefully slid a thick book into the <em>slipcase</em>, silently ascending the <em>staircase</em> in search of the <em>uppercase</em> letters she had misplaced.</p>
