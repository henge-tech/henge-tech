<h2>_cap</h2>
<p>The <em>foolscap</em> was so large that it created a <em>handicap</em> for the man trying to fit it into the <em>hubcap</em> of his car, and so he decided to find something else he could use instead.</p>
<p>The icy <em>icecap</em> on his head gave him the look of a <em>madcap</em>, but his <em>kneecap</em>s were warm enough to protect him from the freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>After a long day, he put on his <em>nightcap</em>, gave a quick <em>recap</em> of his accomplishments, and then found the <em>redcap</em> attendant to help him with his luggage.</p>
<p>On his way to the airport, he saw a man wearing a bright <em>whitecap</em> and a <em>skullcap</em> to protect him from the sun reflecting off the <em>skycap</em> of clouds.</p>
