<h2>_horn</h2>
<p>The bighorn sheep used its sharp blackthorn horns to defend itself from the charging bull, whose angry bellows could be heard for miles with the help of a bullhorn.</p>
<p>As the ship sailed through the thick fog, the foghorn blared repeatedly, alerting other vessels to its presence while the greenhorn musician on board practiced their scales on the flugelhorn.</p>
<p>The leghorn chicken scratched at the ground beneath the hawthorn tree, searching for seeds to eat while the nearby sheep used its horns to fend off predators.</p>
<p>The cowboy used his shoehorn to force his feet into his new pair of longhorn-branded boots, wincing at the thorn that had worked its way into the heel of his left foot.</p>
